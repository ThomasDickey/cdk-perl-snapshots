2013/07/14

	+ reviewed demos/examples, made minor fixes, including using "strict".

	  longer available with Fedora.
	+ adapt RPM spec-file from pld.org for test-builds.
	+ fix build with Perl 5.18 (patch by Niko Tyni, Debian #708593).
	+ modify configure script to add $(BUILDDIR) variable to makefile,

2012/03/24
	+ fix boxes in help-messages, which had top/bottom segments too short.
	+ modified Debian package scripts to copy "examples" directory under
	  package's "examples" directory since the fulldemo scripts expect
	  this layout.
	+ modified Debian package scripts to make exclusion from compressing
	  examples work for Debian 5.0
	+ make default path for help system "dynamic" (report/patch from
	  Debian #519820)

2006/01/03
	+ completed demos/bday
	+ correct a typo in Cdk::Viewer (report/patch from Debian #312733).

2003/12/10
	+ eliminate most of fixed array limits.
	+ correct logic of sv2int(), etc., broken by 2002/07/28 changes.
	+ alter matrix interface to use setCDKMatrixCells() rather than
	  setCDKMatrix(), since the latter dumps core due to an addressing
	  limitation - an 8Mb struct might be too large.
	+ update to match struct-member changes in current CDK snapshot's
	  CDKSWINDOW struct.
	+ replace complex macros except MAKE_CHAR_MATRIX with functions, fix
	  several illegal memory references reported by valgrind.

2002/07/28
	+ change version number to correspond with Exporter.pm documentation.
	+ add a MANIFEST, drop 'FILES' since it is redundant.
	+ drop BUGS and NOTES since they are obsolete.
	+ add Cdk::getVersion() method.
	+ add a null-pointer check in sv2chtype(), needed for return-value from
	  char2Chtype().  Also changed this function to have a single return
	  point.
	+ add fixpaths script, to allow examples and demos to be run easily.
	  Just run fixpaths, and it will adjust the path to 'perl' in the
	  first line of each example-script.

2001/04/21
	+ correct include-path for cdk.h (reports by Pawel Gajda
	  <pawelg@obop.com.pl> and Ron Poulton <thok@technologist.com>)
