2002/7/28 - Thomas Dickey <dickey@herndon4.his.com>
===================================================
	+ change version number to correspond with Exporter.pm documentation.
	+ add a MANIFEST, drop 'FILES' since it is redundant.
	+ drop BUGS and NOTES since they are obsolete.
	+ add Cdk::getVersion() method.
	+ add a null-pointer check in sv2chtype(), needed for return-value from
	  char2Chtype().  Also changed this function to have a single return
	  point.
	+ add fixpaths script, to allow examples and demos to be run easily.
	  Just run fixpaths, and it will adjust the path to 'perl' in the
	  first line of each example-script.

2001/4/21 - Thomas Dickey <dickey@herndon4.his.com>

	+ correct missing Box parameter of drawCDKMenu (Pawel Gajda).

2001/1/7 - Thomas Dickey <dickey@herndon4.his.com>
===================================================
	+ modify to work with perl 5.6.0
	+ fix several places where functions did not return value.
