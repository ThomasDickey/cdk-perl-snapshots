2003/12/10 - Thomas Dickey <dickey@herndon4.his.com>
====================================================
	+ eliminate most of fixed array limits.
	+ correct logic of sv2int(), etc., broken by 2002/07/28 changes.
	+ alter matrix interface to use setCDKMatrixCells() rather than
	  setCDKMatrix(), since the latter dumps core due to an addressing
	  limitation - an 8Mb struct might be too large.
	+ update to match struct-member changes in current CDK snapshot's
	  CDKSWINDOW struct.
	+ replace complex macros except MAKE_CHAR_MATRIX with functions, fix
	  several illegal memory references reported by valgrind.

2002/07/28 - Thomas Dickey <dickey@herndon4.his.com>
====================================================
	+ change version number to correspond with Exporter.pm documentation.
	+ add a MANIFEST, drop 'FILES' since it is redundant.
	+ drop BUGS and NOTES since they are obsolete.
	+ add Cdk::getVersion() method.
	+ add a null-pointer check in sv2chtype(), needed for return-value from
	  char2Chtype().  Also changed this function to have a single return
	  point.
	+ add fixpaths script, to allow examples and demos to be run easily.
	  Just run fixpaths, and it will adjust the path to 'perl' in the
	  first line of each example-script.

2001/04/21 - Thomas Dickey <dickey@herndon4.his.com>
====================================================
	+ correct include-path for cdk.h (reports by Pawel Gajda
	  <pawelg@obop.com.pl> and Ron Poulton <thok@technologist.com>)
	+ correct missing Box parameter of drawCDKMenu (Pawel Gajda).

2001/01/07 - Thomas Dickey <dickey@herndon4.his.com>
====================================================
	+ modify to work with perl 5.6.0
	+ fix several places where functions did not return value.
	+ modify some scripts to show nonblank character, e.g., for slider.
