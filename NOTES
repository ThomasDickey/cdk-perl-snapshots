If you are reading this file, then you are probably having problems compiling 
in the extension. Make sure you have read the README file fully before going
through this document. If you have then read on...

Problems Compiling on Solaris
=============================

Problem: 
	If you are compiling the Cdk extension on a Solaris box against the 
	Solaris curses.h file, then you will notice a conflict in the
	curses.h file. The following message should be displayed when trying
	to compile the Cdk.c file.

"/usr/include/curses.h", line 65: invalid type combination
"/usr/include/curses.h", line 65: warning: useless declaration
"/usr/include/curses.h", line 65: warning: typedef declares no type name
cc: acomp failed for Cdk.c

Solution:
	This is because both Perl and curses.h define a type named bool. Since
	I don't use the curses bool type, you can do one of two things.
	1) Comment out the line 
	typedef       char bool; (should be line 65)
	in curses.h until the compile is done. (Restore it afterwards)
	2) Install Ncurses and compile against that.

	If you comment out the bool, as harsh as that sounds, there are no
	side effects. (I've tried it many times)

Problems Compiling on SUN/OS
============================
Ivan Kohler (ivan@voicenet.com) mailed me and mentioned that when he compiled
the Perl5/Cdk extension on Sun/OS 4.1.4 with ncurses 1.9.9e and Perl v 5.003
there was a typedef collision with 'instr'. The only thing I can say is comment
out the ncurses definition of 'instr' in the curses.h header file. I do not
use the 'instr' function so it should be safe. I wish I didn't have to use this
type of a kludge on typedef collisions, but I can't think of any other way to
resolve the problem. If someone can think of a cleaner method mail me and I
will suggest it.
