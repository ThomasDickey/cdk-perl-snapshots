------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the Perl5 extension to the Cdk library written by Mike Glover.
See MANIFEST for a list of files provided with this extension.

for the current version of this package.

How to build/install:
---------------------

1.  Make sure that Cdk (the C library libcdk and its header files) are
    installed.  For example
	/usr/local/include/cdk/cdk.h (and other files)
	/usr/local/lib/libcdk.a (and perhaps a shared-library)

2.  Run the configure script; it should find the Cdk library and header files.

	make
	make install

Testing the Cdk extension:
--------------------------

There are several examples in the subdirectories of this package:

    demo
	contains a few simple application programs.
    examples
	contains scripts which demonstrate each widget separately.
    fulldemo
	combines all of the widgets into a menu-driven application.
