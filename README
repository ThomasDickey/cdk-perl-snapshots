Cdk Perl5 Extension,
Mike Glover, Copyright 1995-1999
Thomas Dickey modifications copyright 1999-2001, 2002

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the Perl5 extension to the Cdk library written by Mike Glover.
See MANIFEST for a list of files provided with this extension.
See COPYING for the licensing terms for this package.
See
	http://invisible-island.net/cdk/
	ftp://invisible-island.net/cdk/
for the current version of this package.

How to build/install:
---------------------

1.  Make sure that Cdk (the C library libcdk and its header files) are
    installed.  Normally those are
	/usr/local/include/cdk/cdk.h (and other files)
	/usr/local/lib/libcdk.a (and perhaps a shared-library)

2.  Modify Makefile.PL as needed to tell the compiler where to find the Cdk
    library and header files.  In particular, these values may require change:

    * LIBS tells the compiler where to find the Cdk and curses libraries.  Just
      change the -L paths to reflect what is on your system.  Leave the -lcdk
      and -lcurses.  You may have to change -lcurses to -lncurses, for
      instance.

    * INC tells the compiler where to find the header files.  Just change the
      -I paths to reflect what is on your system.

3.  If your version of perl supports dynamic loading, it is simple to
    add new packages.  Run these commands
	perl Makefile.PL
	make install
    to generate a makefile for your configuration, build and install the
    extension.  (The process of building perl with statically loaded extensions
    is more complicated).

Testing the Cdk extension:
--------------------------

There are several examples in the subdirectories of this package:

    demo
	contains a few simple application programs.
    examples
	contains scripts which demonstrate each widget separately.
    fulldemo
	combines all of the widgets into a menu-driven application.
